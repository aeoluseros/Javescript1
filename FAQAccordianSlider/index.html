                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Bear Call Spread
            </li>
            <li class="a">A bear call spread is a type of vertical spread. It contains two calls with the same expiration but different strikes. The strike price of the short call is below the strike of the long call, which means this strategy will always generate a net cash inflow (net credit) at the outset.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Bear Put Spread
            </li>
            <li class="a">A bear put spread consists of buying one put and selling another put, at a lower strike, to offset part of the upfront cost. The spread generally profits if the stock price moves lower. The potential profit is limited, but so is the risk should the stock unexpectedly rally.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Bull Call Spread
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy consists of buying one call option and selling another at a higher strike price to help pay the cost. The spread generally profits if the stock price moves higher, just as a regular long call strategy would, up to the point where the short call caps further gains.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Bull Put Spread
            </li>
            <li class="a">A bull put spread is a limited-risk-limited-reward strategy, consisting of a short put option and a long put option with a lower strike. This spread generally profits if the stock price holds steady or rises.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Cash-Backed Call
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy allows an investor to purchase stock at the lower of strike price or market price during the life of the option.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Cash-Secured Put
            </li>
            <li class="a">The cash-secured put involves writing a put option and simultaneously setting aside the cash to buy the stock if assigned. If things go as hoped, it allows an investor to buy the stock at a price below its current market value.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Collar
            </li>
            <li class="a">The investor adds a collar to an existing long stock position as a temporary, slightly less-than-complete hedge against the effects of a possible near-term decline. The long put strike provides a minimum selling price for the stock, and the short call strike sets a maximum price.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Covered Call
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy consists of writing a call that is covered by an equivalent long stock position. It provides a small hedge on the stock and allows an investor to earn premium income, in return for temporarily forfeiting much of the stock's upside potential.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Covered Put
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy is used to arbitrage a put that is overvalued because of its early-exercise feature. The investor simultaneously sells an in-the-money put at its intrinsic value and shorts the stock, and then invests the proceeds in an instrument earning the overnight interest rate. When the option is exercised, the position liquidates at breakeven, but the investor keeps the interest earned.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Covered Ratio Spread
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy profits if the underlying stock moves up to, but not above, the strike price of the short calls. Beyond that, the profit is eroded and then hits a plateau.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Covered Strangle
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy is appropriate for a stock considered to be fairly valued. The investor has a long stock position and is willing to sell the stock if it goes higher or buy more of the stock if it goes lower.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Call
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy consists of buying a call option. It is a candidate for investors who want a chance to participate in the underlying stock's expected appreciation during the term of the option. If things go as planned, the investor will be able to sell the call at a profit at some point before expiration.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Call Butterfly
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy profits if the underlying stock is at the body of the butterfly at expiration.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Call Calendar Spread
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy combines a longer-term bullish outlook with a near-term neutral/bearish outlook. If the underlying stock remains steady or declines during the life of the near-term option, that option will expire worthless and leave the investor owning the longer-term option free and clear. If both options have the same strike price, the strategy will always require paying a premium to initiate the position.

            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Call Condor
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy profits if the underlying security is between the two short call strikes at expiration.
            </li>
            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Condor

            <li class="q">
                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Put
            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy consists of buying puts as a means to profit if the stock price moves lower. It is a candidate for bearish investors who want to participate in an anticipated downturn, but without the risk and inconveniences of selling the stock short.

            <li class="q">

                <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Ratio Call Spread
            </li>
            <li class="a">The initial cost to initiate this strategy is rather low, and may even earn a credit, but the upside potential is unlimited. The basic concept is for the total delta of the two long calls to roughly equal the delta of the single short call. If the underlying stock only moves a little, the change in value of the option position will be limited. But if the stock rises enough to where the total delta of the two long calls approaches 200 the strategy acts like a long stock position.

            </li>
            <li class="a">The initial cost to initiate this strategy is rather low, and may even earn a credit, but the downside potential is substantial. The basic concept is for the total delta of the two long puts to roughly equal the delta of the single short put. If the underlying stock only moves a little, the change in value of the option position will be limited. But if the stock declines enough to where the total delta of the two long puts approaches 200 the strategy acts like a short stock position.

            <img src="img/arrow.png"> Long Stock
        </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy is simple. It consists of acquiring stock in anticipation of rising prices. The gains, if there are any, are realized only when the asset is sold. Until that time, the investor faces the possibility of partial or total loss of the investment, should the stock lose value.

            </li>
            <li class="a">This strategy consists of buying a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration. The combination generally profits if the stock price moves sharply in either direction during the life of the options.
